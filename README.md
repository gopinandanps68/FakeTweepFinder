 
The proliferation of advanced AI models, such as GPT-3, has enabled the generation of highly realistic and human-like text, complicating the identification of machine-generated content on social media platforms. This poses a significant challenge, particularly on platforms like Twitter, where adversaries exploit generative AI to disseminate misinformation, manipulate public opinion, and conduct malicious activities. Detecting such "deepfake tweets" is further hindered by the sophisticated quality of AI-generated text, the adaptability of malicious actors, and the rapid pace of social media, which demands scalable, real-time solutions. Existing detection tools often fail due to limited feature extraction and their inability to keep up with evolving AI capabilities. This project aims to develop an advanced fake tweet detection system that leverages robust feature extraction, adaptive learning models, and scalable real-time processing to effectively identify and mitigate the spread of AI-generatedÂ misinformation.
